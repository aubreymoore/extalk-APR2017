## Basic Biology

![](Rhino_Beetle_Life_Cycle.png)

- Grubs feed on decaying vegetation and do no damage.
- Adults damage and sometimes kill palms when they bore into crowns to feed on sap.

## Positive Feedback Cycle

![](feedback.png)

- A population explosion can occur when large numbers of adults kill palms which become breeding sites which generate even larger numbers of adults.

## CRB on Guam

- First detected in Tumon, September, 2007
- Eradication attempt based on mass trapping and sanitation failed
- CRB spread island-wide by 2010
- Attempts at biological control using Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) failed

## Oryctes Nudivirus

- a naturally occurring virus which attacks only rhino beetles
- discovered in Malaysia during the 1960's
- quickly became the preferred biological control agent for managing CRB on Pacific islands
- prevents population explosions
- is persistent once introduced into a CRB population

## Oryctes Nudivirus

![](virus_damage_reduction.png)

- OrNV reduced damage by up to 90% when introduced into Pacific island CRB populations and population suppression was persistent.

## CRB Attacking Guam is a Novel Biotype (CRB-Guam)

- genetically different
- resistant to all available isolates of OrNV
- more invasive

## CRB-Guam is Genetically Different

## CRB-Guam is More Invasive

- Following 30 years without range expansion, CRB has recently invaded Guam, Oahu (Hawaii), Guadalcanal (Solomon Islands), and Port Morseby (PNG). All new invasions involve CRB-Guam.

## Recent Changes on Guam

- A CRB population explosion triggered by Typhoon Dolphin was predicted in the
following press release.

## Recent Changes on Guam

<img src="trapcatch.png" style="height: 350px"/>

- Recent trapping data indicate that a CRB population explosion was initiated
by Typhoon Dolphin which visited Guam in May 2015, leaving many new breeding sites in its wake.
