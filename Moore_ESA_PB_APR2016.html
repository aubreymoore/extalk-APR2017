<!-- CRB Biology and Population Ecology --------------------------------------->

<section data-markdown>
![supersizeme](life_cycle.png)
Note:
- Grubs feed on decaying vegetation and do no damage.
- Adults damage and sometimes kill palms when they bore into crowns to feed on sap.
- Females lay about 100 eggs. Potential population growth rate of 5,000% per generation.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-background="breeding_sites.png">

Note:
- Greater than 90% of a CRB population will be found in breeding site aggregations
- Favorite habitat for breeding sites is dead standing coconut stems and decaying
coconut logs.
- However, they will thrive in anything high in organic material including
green waste, grass clippings, sawdust piles, and manure.
- In the lab, we rear CRB from egg to adult on a store bought blend of steer
manure and soil.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
![size90](chapel_breeding_site1.png)

Note:
Here's an example of a small breeding site in an urban setting, consiting
of greenwaste in a planting bed about 3 feet wid by 30 feet long by 2 fee deep.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
![size90](chapel_breeding_site2.png)

Note:
More than 300 CRB were removed from this site and the greenwaste was replaceed
with sandd.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-background="bore_hole.png">

Note:
- Adults bore into crowns of coconuts or other palms to feed on sap.
- Adults leave the bore hole after 2 or 3 days.
- Adults feed several times.
- Developing fronds are damaged when a beetle bores through them.
- Palms are killed if the meristem is damaged.
- Palms may regrow a full canopy of CRB damage is stoped. However, bore holes
do not heal, leaving palm structurally week and succeptible to beheading
strong winds.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-background="vcuts.png">

Note:
- Distinctive v-shaped cut are evidence of a CRB feeding even several months prior.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
![size80](feedback.png)

Note:
- A positive feedback cycle may be initiated if the adult CRB population is high enough
to kill large numbers of palms.
- Dead standing trunks become breeding sites
which produce even higher numbers of beetles.
- Feedback cycle may be initiated when abundant breeding sites are created by typhoons,
agricultural clearing, or war.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
![supersizeme](map.png)

Note:
- native range is SE Asia
- CRB arrived in the South Pacific with shipments of rubber plants from Ceylon
to Samoa in the early 1900s
- arrived in Palau during WWII
- no range expansion between 1975 and 2007
- only 1 successful eradication out of several attempts

<section data-markdown>
  ![size90](delimiting_survey.png)

Note:
- A decision to attempt eradication was based upon delimiting survey results
indicating that CRB occupied only a relatively small area.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Guam CRB Eradication Project Tactics
- mass trapping: FAILED
- sanitation: SUCCEEDED
- quarantine: FAILED

Note:
- mass trapping: new damage to palms observed in mass trapping areas
- sanitation: damage reduction observed in sanitized area
- quarantine: CRB transported to greeenwaste dump sites and plant nurseries
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    ![size90](tm37.png)

Note:
- By Feb 2011, CRB had escaped from Tumon to other parts of Guam
- Control efforts transitioned from eradication to development and implementation of
integrated pest management
- Implementation of biocontrol became a priority

# Biological Control for CRB
- Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV)
    - Typically results in 90% damage reduction within a few months
    - Density-dependent control lasts indefinitely
    - **Failed for the first time on Guam**

- *Metarhizium majus*, Green muscardine fungus (GMF)
    - Successfully introduced from the Philippines
    - Surveys indicate that mortality from GMF is about 20%

    Source: [Marshall S, Moore A.  2014.  DNA analysis of Hawaii CRB.](http://guaminsects.net/anr/content/dna-analysis-hawaii-crb)

Note:
    - Original intent of DNA analysis was to determine potential origins for the Guam CRB invasion
    - Prior to 2013, we had no matches
    - DNA from the first 4 beetles captured in Hawaii matched
    - DNA from new invasion in Port Morseby (Papua New Guinea) and Solomon Islands match
    - Palau and Port Morseby have mixed populations
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    ![size90](tree_diag.png)

Note:
- OrNV has not been deected in the CRB Guam biotype
- Infection rates in other genotypes run as high as 80%
</section>

<section data-markdown>
![supersizeme](map.png)

Note:
- Following 30 years without range expansion, CRB has recently invaded Guam, Oahu (Hawaii), Guadalcanal (Solomon Islands), and Port Morseby (PNG)
- All recent invasions involve CRB-Guam
- Palau has a mixed population; damage increasing
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# CRB Attacking Guam is a Novel Biotype (CRB-Guam)
- genetically different
- resistant to all available isolates of OrNV
- more invasive (all 4 new invasions since 2007 involve CRB-G)
- behavioral differences ???
    - not highly attracted to oryctalure
    - arboreal breeding sites
    - higher per-capita damage
</section>

#Discovery of the CRB-Guam Biotype
- Marshall, Sean, Maclean Vaqalo, Aubrey Moore, Roland Quitugua, and Trevor Jackson (2015).
**A new invasive biotype of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) has
escaped from biological control by Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus.** Presented at
the International Congress on Invertebrate Pathology and Microbial Control and
the 48th Annual Meeting of the Society for Invertebrate Pathology, Vancouver,
BC, August 2015. Available on-line at
http://www.sipmeeting.org/van1/SIP2015-Full%20Program.pdf

Note:
This OrNV resistant biotype has the potential to invade all cocconut growing areas,
including new islands and counties in SE Asia where CRB is naturally controlled by
OrNV. Efects on coconut and oil palm crops could be disasterous.

#Discovery of the CRB-Guam Biotype

biotype).** International Association for the Plant Protection Sciences
Newsletter (XI). November, 2015. Available on-line at
https://www.plantprotection.org/portals/0/documents/newsletters/2015/iapps%2011-2015.pdf

Note:
An emergency response to CRB-G is needed to minimize damage on newly invaded islands, thereby
reducing risk of further spread.

    ![size60](tree_of_life.jpg)

Note:
Invasion of islands where coconut is still the "tree of life" will be disasterous.

Note:
Possible interactions coupled with climate change:
- Rapid erosion causeed by sea rise an loss off coconuts.
- Breedng sites created by stronger andd more
frequent typhoons and hurricanes.
